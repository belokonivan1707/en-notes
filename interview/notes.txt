2. What was the most significant challenge you faced in your previous project?

In my previous project, the most harderst challenge I faced revolved around the onboarding process.
This project has a vast scope of numerous different repositories: 
custom components libraries, specialized services and so on. 
Additionally, sizable development team and a complex Adgile system.
Consequently, effective communication skills were of paramount importance, 
along with the ability to navigate through a substantial amount of code.
However, after a few weeks of working on bug fixes, it was my luck, 
they assigned on with a big new feature which was estimated on five month.
This feature required rewriting the creator-facing product application with a fresh design and updated business logic. 
While this period was significant challenges, it also provided me with invaluable experience and growth opportunities.
