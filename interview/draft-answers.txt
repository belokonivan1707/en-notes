1. Could you please describe the details and scope of the last project you worked on?


"In my last project, I worked as a web developer on a client-facing e-commerce website. 
The goal of the project was to create a modern and user-friendly online store for our client's products. 
The scope of the project involved developing the front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
and integrating it with a back-end system for product management and order processing.

My responsibilities included collaborating with the design team to implement the user interface,
ensuring responsiveness across different devices and browsers, and optimizing the website for performance and speed. 
I also worked closely with the back-end developers to integrate the front-end with the underlying database and APIs.

Throughout the project, I actively participated in agile development methodologies, 
attending daily stand-up meetings and contributing to sprint planning and retrospectives. 
I also conducted thorough testing and debugging to identify and fix any issues or bugs that arose during development.

Overall, the project was a success, and we delivered the website within the specified timeline and budget. 
The client was pleased with the final result, as the website achieved their goals of providing an intuitive 
shopping experience and driving conversions. It was a valuable experience that allowed me to further enhance my skills in 
web development, teamwork, and project management."
