No, I don’t mind if we communicate. When I don’t answer, it’s because I’m busy with my work or something else. 
But if the exchanges are cordial, 
respectful and interesting, I always enjoy chatting with people, regardless of their country of origin.

We all need to find refuges to maintain balance.
I'm not depressed, but I've had anxiety since I was a kid. 
Everything passes, even if it takes time. Try to find things and people that make you feel good.

I can't even imagine how awful it must be. 
I hear things on the radio and I watch the news on TV. 
What I hear and what I read are frightening. 
I often tell myself that the human species does not have to be very evolved to kill each other 
for stories of power and money. In the end, once we are dead, money and power will be nothing. 
It is incomprehensible all this suffering that the people are subjected to. 

We are ruled by sociopathic megalomaniacs.
