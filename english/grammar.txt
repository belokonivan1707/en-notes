When I was a kid I was used to playing a lot - 
I am used to going to sleep at 1am - я привык 
I used to smoke a lot  - Раньше я много курил 
I would smoke a lot - Раньше я много курил 

I used to smoke. 
I didn't use to smoke, now I smoke a lot
Did you use to smoke?

I'm used to the noise. I don't even hear it.
Teenagers are used to studying.
I'm used to waking up early.
I'm used to spicy food.

I'm still getting used to everything. There so much for me to learn.
You'll get used to smoking a lot.
I can't get used to the war.
In the hole my life I haven't got used to driving car. 


I got used to smoking  -  Я наконецто привык курению
