1.Do you do sports much?

I used to have a lot of active rest, but not anymore. 
Active rest for me mean some kind of sport. 
It was different habbits like a riding on bycycle, 
kayaking in different plases, travaling and walking, sometimes gym or workout.
I could got a bycycle and go to some kind of sport ground near the river. 
Don't like gyms last couple years, I feel there like a mouse in cage, 
but 7 years ago it was one of my favorite sport habbits. Anyway

Mostly I spent time at home last year, or in office, 
or sometimes visited friends, again in concrete box. 

But with coming of spring I am trying to getting used to moving more. 
In best days I walk ten kilometers a day.
I don't tend to waste all free time in concrete box. 



2.Do you listen to music much?

I listening music all the time. Offcourse sometimes I have periods of life, 
when I stop listening music becuse can't find similar music to my mood.
But anyway, I have more than two thousand songs in my labrary, 
making playlist by sorting songs for different mental states.


3. Do you go to the theatre much?
Very rarely. to be honest, from the last five years It was only once.
